          amount and/or term. There is no obligation to accept the alternative
          offer if it doesn't meet your needs. Please refer to their Terms &

                an online loan broker for the short-term loan, instalment loan
                and personal loan market. Working alongside some of the biggest
                direct lenders, we remove the need to search multiple different
                unsecured loan providers; instead we do all of the hard work for
                you searching a panel of more than 50 direct lenders and brokers
                in real time, to return a quick loan decision. <br /><br />
                If you need a loan for any legal purpose, then we can help.
                Looking for a new car loan, or perhaps you simply need some
                short term cash to pay bills or an emergency loan for some other
                reason? Whatever your requirements, simply complete our short
                form and you will receive an instant online decision.
                <br /><br />
                Once you submit an application, our smart loan sourcing engine
                instantly searches 100s of short term loan products and puts you
                in touch with a suitable direct lender / broker. If we are
                unable to source a loan for you, we may offer an alternative
                product such as a credit card or credit reporting product.
                <br /><br />
                We regret to inform customers that we do not offer pay day loans
                or no credit check loans however, our short term loans are a
                great alternative to a traditional pay day loan (although
                acceptance is not guaranteed).

              Applicants must be over the age 18 and a UK resident to apply. All
              applications will be subject to credit checks which could result
              in the search being recorded on your credit file. The credit check
              process could potentially have damaging influences on your credit
              file. All affordability assessments will be carried out in line
              with the individual direct lenders lending criteria. <br /><br />
              Short term loans are not a suitable solution for people in
              financial difficulty or for longer term borrowing. Late repayments
              or missed payments may be reported to the credit reference
              agencies, which may affect your credit rating and could make
              obtaining a loan in the future more difficult and expensive.

              TFLI (US) INC is an Appointed Representative of TFLI Limited, who
              acts as a credit broker and is not a lender. We use a consumer
              application system to allow our customers to make applications to
              a number of loan providers and brokers using a single online
              application form. <br /><br />
              We work exclusively with a selected group of lenders and credit
              brokers to offer you a range of credit and loan products. We may
              receive a percentage of the loan amount as a commission from a
              loan provider or broker if you take out one of their products
              and/or we may receive a fee for introducing you to them.
              <br /><br />
              You can request details of these commissions or fees, by emailing
              us at fees@tfli.us. We will then provide you with the precise
              amount of the commission or fee or, where that amount is not
              known, the likely amount. Please note that the lender or broker we
              direct you to may not offer the cheapest loan that is available to
              meet your needs.
              <br /><br />
              When you apply for a loan through us the lender will disclose
              directly to you all of the relevant information relating to
              interest and charges associated with the loan.
              <br /><br />
              *The majority of loan applications are processed online, however
              there are circumstances where our lenders will need to call you.
              Further information relating to why lenders will need to call you
              is disclosed within their terms & conditions.
